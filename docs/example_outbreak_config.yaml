tree_fields: adm1,HCW_status #To indicate specific fields by the tips in the tree - must be provided in query or background metadata
colour-by: adm1, HCW_status:Paired #This will colour tips on the tree by these fields. Adm1 will be using the default colour scheme, and HCW_status will use the matplotlib colour map "Paired"
label_fields: [sample_date, care_home] #These fields will be added to labels on the tree and on the timeline (if timeline is shown)
table_fields: [uk_lineage, phylotype, global_lineage] #These will be added to the summary table at the top. NB the full table is written to civet_metadata.csv
display_name: patient_ID #A more informative name to replace COG IDs throughout the report. Please provide in the query metadata csv.
