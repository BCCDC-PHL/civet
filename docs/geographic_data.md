## Administrative level 2 (adm2) values

The following adm2 values are accepted by all civet mapping functions, including the local lineages analysis. Note that they are all in capitals and have had commas and spaces removed and replaced with underscores.

If a location is not in the list, it will not be accepted. However, some postcodes and commonly used locations do not map completely to one adm2 region. In these cases, list the possible adm2s from the options below, using the pipe symbol `|` to separate them. Commonly used regions and their corresponding adm2 list are shown under the relevant country below.  

For example, if "West Midlands" appears in the query input, replace it with `BIRMINGHAM|COVENTRY|DUDLEY|SANDWELL|SOLIHULL|WALSALL|WOLVERHAMPTON` and the mapping functions will work.

NB While the list of accepted adm2s is a standard list, these instructions are *only for civet* and should not be viewed as instructions for metadata input into the COG-UK pipeline.

### Northern Ireland
NB for now, both historical counties and correct adm2s are accepted as the metadata is a mixture of the two, and they are non-compatible naming systems. This may change in the future.
