### -i / --input

<strong>civet</strong> automatically detects a number of different inputs:

<strong>input.csv</strong>

Input csv file with an identifier column. By default <strong>civet</strong> will look for a column called `name` but this can be changed with the `--input-column` flag.

Example csv:
| name | status | adm2 | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| sample1 | HCW | Edinburgh | 
| sample2 | HCW | Edinburgh | 
| sample3 | Patient | Edinburgh | 
| sample4 | HCW | Edinburgh | 

```
civet -i input.csv
```
<strong>ID string</strong>

A comma separated string of ids that civet trys to match against the database (you can define what field you want to match against with `--data-column`, the default is will match against the COG-UK ID).
```
civet -i EGID001,EGID002
```
<strong>A configuration file in yaml format</strong>

A yaml (or yml) config file that describes the analysis you want to run and the type of report you want to generate.

You can provide any of the command line arguments via this config file, for instance pass the input.csv or ID string in through via the configuation file.

Using this input option will allow the user to run very specific, elaborate reports again and again, without having to specify all arguments via the command line.

Note, if the same option is specified in the config file and as a command line argument, the command line argument will overwrite the config file option. 
```
civet -i config.yaml
```
### --generate-config
The yaml file can be created manually or can be generated by runnnig civet with the set of command line arguments you want to specify in conjunction with the `--generate-config` flag. 

It will not run the analysis, but will produce a template config.yaml file that you can use again and again. 

### -fm / --from-metadata

If all sequences of interest are in the background tree and metadata, the user can opt to define a set of query sequences using the ``--from-metadata`` flag. 

To do this, supply one or more of ``column_name=match_string`` pairs. For example:
```
civet -fm adm2=Edinburgh sample_date=2020-09-20
```

civet can also detect and filter by date ranges:
```
civet -fm sample_date=2020-05-01:2020-06-01
```

A <strong>civet</strong> instance is then run with the sequences that match the search parameters.
